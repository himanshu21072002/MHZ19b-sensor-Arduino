# MHZ19b-sensor-Arduino
<p>
•	Developed a CO2 monitoring device using sensors for use in automotive applications. <br>
•	Designed and implemented an interface between an SD card module and an Arduino board using a Data logger shield.<br>
•	Implemented rolling mean to predict CO2 reading variations, replacing current time readings with the mean of the last 10 readings.<br>
•	Conducted in-depth data analysis of sensor readings to extract meaningful insights and trends.
